On those devices, the big blue dot showing my location hovers nicely right on top of my house. It begs the question: why can't the Google Maps app on my Kindle Fire HD7 do the same thing, considering the fact that wifi and location services on that device are both turned on and working properly?<br /><br />After making several unsuccessful attempts to solve this problem, I finally gave up and uninstalled Google Maps from my Kindle Fire HD7.

First off, we needed to find the Aquarium and got lost and the app put us right in front of it.  That night we were in a rush to get to a restaurant, got a little turned around, and again, got us right to the restaurant.  The next day, in a driving downpour, we were going from Santa Monica to the Ferry Terminal in San Pedro.  Traffic a nightmare, we were late.  It re-routed us and saved us 15 minutes and then, we got lost in the spaghetti that is the Port front, and it rescued us again.  Plus while leaving the harbor several days later, it told us how to get on the freeway, which was  a little tricky.<br /><br />It's been less than 5 days since I downloaded this app and I've relied on it several times.<br /><br />Ok, so it's not absolutely perfect.  While travelling down the 280 freeway to catch the 101 to Monterey, it had us go through several small towns crossing from 280 to 101 on the 85.  It's really too complicated to get into suffice it to say, it had us take Edgewater (or something like that) well before the 85 which took about 10 to 15 extra minutes.  So as with many of these apps, you've got to use your best judgement.  It just didn't feel right exiting at that point, and we were right about that.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I relied on it several times during our trip and it was a terrific help.  I'll use it again and recommend it.",2015-05-15

US,45054976,R34GCA6LJ6Z7NK,B00SZFFC2I,563944246,Google Maps,Mobile_Apps,4,8,12,0,1,"Great data and directions, but awful and non-intuitive user interface features so hidden they could inspire a Robert Frost poem","Google maps has great data, but I feel that their UI is not very intuitive and special features like street map are too hard to figure out unless you've used the app several times before.  I don't understand the color scheme or the icons they chose.  Perhaps this is eco-system centric, but I really don't think so.  For instance, in Apple maps if I want to know where I am, I can press a button that looks like a compass, because intuitively I think of compass helping me find where I am.  On the Google maps app, it's like some kind of periscope, I think, or maybe some kind of gun sight?  It's a circle with some ticks surrounding it.  I struggle to even describe it, which is good indication it's not intutive, especially not for its form factor (quick, at a glance understanding without having to perform deep critical thinking in order to map something strange to something familiar).<br /><br />Another example is accessing special functions (like street view).  If I want to see more details about a site in Apple maps, I can drop a pin/marker and click on it to see a callout, and there's an (i) button that tells me there is a drillthrough / detail page that I can get access to in order to view more special functions, such as satellite view in Apple maps or flyover.  But in google maps there's no such context-clue that more information is available.  When you select a location / drop a pin or marker, you can either find your current location (this button is always in front of your face and never out of the way, even when you have dropped a pin in some other location and it doesn't really have much relevance anymore) or get directions there (the blue symbol with walk, drive, etc).  But where do I get street view?  You could search forever trying to find it until you finally realize you should just click on the address, even though there is no context-clue (such as a hyperlink or a drillthrough &#62;&#62; symbol, or an (i) button, etc) that tells you that more actions are hidden beneath.<br /><br />Finally, once you get the street view option after accidently discovering this context menu, you still may not know how to get the actual street view to load.  Instead, you just get a panorama picture that says &#34;Street view&#34;. Apple maps has a button that says &#34;3D&#34; and you know if you click it, that something 3D is going to happen.  Why don't I get a button that says &#34;street view&#34; and if I click it I know something is going to happen.  Eventually you discover that anything can be a button and anything can be an action, such as clicking on the panorama that says street view.  Users psychologically may then be wary that anything they click may have a consequence / perform an action, and therefore be less trusting and confident of the UI.",2015-05-09
