Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a &quot;station&quot; or &quot;mix&quot; and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me.

When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.  When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.    Now, I'm just disappointed.    I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.  That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:    1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.  Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?    2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.  Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.    3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.  Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to \\""The Color Spectrum\\"" and it decides to throw a song from \\""Migrant\\"" in the mix, that's really jarring.  Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like \\""Of Great and Mortal Men\\"".).  You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?  Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from \\""Migrant\\"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.    Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.  Spotify on myKindle?

I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD)<br />I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.<br />However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!",2015-07-18,positive,negative,positive,negative

Because I love Spotify. It's essentially all I listen to when I'm at the desktop so putting it on my tablet seemed a no-brainer. And when it worked it was great. The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small (Less than 17 songs?), it would start throwing in random songs, as though you'd created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I'll make a playlist with a single song because, well, that's how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the \\""suggested\\"" songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there wasn't enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it's still worth a try.

At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service.  Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN.  Where to begin...<br />First, disclaimer:  I'm an audiophile.  I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies.  I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake.  So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.<br />1.  Algorithm.  Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably.  All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock.  In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement.<br />2. GUI.  Not horrible, but certainly not the best.  Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready.  Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!!  If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly.  Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.<br />3. Paying to play owned music.  This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person.  While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly?????  Can someone make sense ofthis to me?  Why are people paying for this, again????  Ridiculous.  Developers:  The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!!  Otherwise, why even have this feature?  Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service.  Let the people play their owned music for free.<br />4. Equalizer.  Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  Look up Poweramp.<br />5. Cost.  So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good.  Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT.  Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???<br />Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?<br />HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price).  If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify.",2014-09-11,negative,negative,negative,neutral

Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I don't remember why, but it made sense at the time.<br /><br />So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs (in general). I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do.

Any time I have used Spotify since its beta, I can't help but think that it is designed to keep you from its main purpose; listening to music. Finding artists albums and songs are easy enough, but listening to the music is frequently interrupted with adverstisements (much more often than like services such as Pandora). The music also stops playing on many of my devices when in standby mode after a random amount of time for some reason.

The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs).

Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.<br /><br />The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets.

With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose.

It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info.<br />Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.<br /><br />UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again.",2014-11-19,positive,positive,positive,neutral

I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since &#34;sold&#34; this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have &#34;disposable&#34; playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S.

Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist (although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plus)<br />So my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy.

I can spend hours a day creating ...,"Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.<br /><br />Happy Listening Spotifyers!<br />Cheers!",2014-10-24,,,,

I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out.

CDs upped the ante.  MP3s, portable digital players and satellite radio further extended content and quality.  Then something wonderful happened and changed everything: enter Spotify.<br />Spotify’s paid subscription delivers ad-free all you can eat music with every song you can think of and access to every genre old and new.  Combine that with phenomenal quality and universal streaming access via any smart device – PC, smart TV, streaming media player, tablet and smartphone – and musical nirvana is mine.<br />In practice, Spotify can be quite daunting.  What genre, group, album or song would I like to listen to now or download to my device for later?  Spotify makes answering this question easier with options for matching your mood or activity with playlists supplied by Spotify experts and other users as well as searching and browsing tools that deliver clear results with helpful, relevant recommendations.<br />The Spotify experience plays out differently across each of my typical use cases – desktop PC with near-field monitor speakers, tablet with Bluetooth connection to living room home theater sound system and smartphone with Bluetooth connection to car stereo or wireless headphones – but each one delivers exceptional results.<br />Frankly, exploring Spotify on a 24 inch desktop computer display and hearing the results on studio-quality monitors pointed at each ear is thrilling.  This is where I can truly grasp even the finest musical nuances and how I can accurately judge Spotify’s streaming media as excellent.<br />Spotify on my 8.9 inch Kindle HD adds a novel musical dimension to sitting on the living room couch or hanging in the kitchen with family and friends, enabling one and all to queue their favorites, contributing background or central focus for conversation.  Handing the Bluetooth connected tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theater’s surround sound with subwoofer speakers.  Recently, I introduced a friend with a room-sized, wall to wall audio collection to Spotify, who said this tablet solution could, should and would replace his shelves and stacks with instant musical gratification.<br />Smartphone Spotify brings an endless mobile musical mix to the gym and in the car.  In both cases, I typically rely on a quick search for a favorite group or mood-matching playlist, then get moving.  My Bluetooth headset’s controls make it easy to pause, skip or replay tunes playing on the Spotify app without touching my phone.  On the road with my smartphone connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth, the Spotify app’s big Shuffle Play button makes moving past less desired tracks effortless while maintaining the spontaneity akin to broadcast radio.<br />While all these options for consuming music are first rate, the most important service feature remains Spotify’s monumental breadth and scope.  The collection offered by Spotify fulfills my dual desires for deep diving in my musical past as well as expanding my horizons.ed tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theater’s surround sound with subwoofer speakers.

I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .<br /><br />Best wishes,2014-08-13,,,,

I was able to cancel sat radio and limit my streaming on my cell with spotify.  I took advantage of the student price for my subscription.  The only issue I have is that I listen to a wide range of music.  One of my favorite genre is kpop.  I am not able to find much to download.,2014-07-09,,,,
